# Shop-Prototype
Here's a simple yet functional shop prototype developed in Unity, focusing on showcasing mechanics and potential interactions.

Purchase new items from the shop with the Coin icon, facilitated by a uniquely code generated UI.
Following this, replenish your supplies to ensure NPCs can continue purchasing your clothing.
Repeat this process until you amass wealth :^)
